   <h1>History of the Miami Dolphins</h1>
<br>
   <h2>Early Years</h2>

   <p class="text">The Miami Dolphins began playing regular fixtures in the AFL in 1966. This early start made them Florida's first pro football team. As describe by the "Pro Football Hall of Fame," no other team has made such leaps in the first six years of existence than Miami from 1966 to 1972. In this stretch the Dolphins managed to become the first team since the merger of the AFL and NFL. Their first season wasn't the best. They got off to a dissapointing start, but change was just around the corner. In 1970, new head coach Don Shula lead the Dolphins to a 10-4 record, cementing their spot in a playoff spot. After the 1970 season they went three straight years where they didn't miss the palyoffs. In this span they had their famous undefeated season where they went the whole year without losing a single game then went on to win the superbowl to end the year with a 17-0 record. They would secure two more superbowl appearences in following years one of those being a victory. They would'nt appear in another superbowl for the remainder of the 70's.</p>

   <h2> The 80's Dolphins</h2>

   <p class="text">The 80's would be a decade of dissapointment and underperformance in the playoffs for the Dolphins. The decade started with the Dolphins drafting Dan Marino in the 1983 draft.In the span of his career he wouldn't lead the Dolphins to a super bowl win but he would set the season passing touchdown record (48). In the 17-year span that Marino would play for Miami he would only play in one superbowl despite the great amount of success in the regular season. Tragically he would get injured in the game and the Dolphins in his absence would collapse and end up losing to the 49ers by a score of 38-16. They would never again play in another SuperBowl again.  </p>

   <p class="text">The Dolphins would enter an era of mediocrity. While winning season weren't "rare", there were spans of three to four years where they were at the bottom of the league table. Dissapointment would reach an all time high when in 2007 the Dolphins woul win a single game. Following the 2007 season they would hire SuperBowl winning coach, Bill Parcels. The following season they would complete the biggest single season turn around in NFL history by winning 11 games. Following that season they would'nt win more than 10 games a single time. Their highest record since came in the 2020-2021 season with a record of 10-6.  </p>
